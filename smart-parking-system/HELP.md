🧩 What is ApplicationEventPublisher?
. ApplicationEventPublisher is a core Spring interface used to publish events within the application context, following the Observer pattern.
. Starting from Spring 4.2, you can publish any object (not just those extending ApplicationEvent), and Spring wraps it in a PayloadApplicationEvent internally
. Usage is straightforward: inject via @Autowired and call:
applicationEventPublisher.publishEvent(new YourEvent(...));
or implement ApplicationEventPublisherAware to receive the publisher reference
🔧 Example Publisher
`@Component

public class MyEventPublisher {
    @Autowired
    private ApplicationEventPublisher publisher;

public void publish(String msg) {
        publisher.publishEvent(new CustomSpringEvent(this, msg));
    }
}
`
🎧 What is @EventListener?
The @EventListener annotation marks a method to receive and handle application events:
. You can listen for either a single event type or specify multiple types via classes = {EventA.class, EventB.class}
. If only one event class is declared, the method can have a parameter of that type.
. If multiple types are specified, the method must have no parameters (per Java-doc constraints)
. Event types can be Spring's built-in ApplicationEvent or any object/payload type
. Methods declared with a non-void return type automatically cause the returned value(s) to be re‑published as new events—arrays or collections result in multiple events
. You can filter event handling using a SpEL condition attribute, and define listener ordering via @Order
. To process events asynchronously, annotate the listener with @Async and enable async support in the configuration; note async listener methods cannot reuse return values as new events.
🔧 Example Listener

`@Component

public class MyEventListener {

@EventListener
    public void onCustomEvent(CustomSpringEvent evt) {
        System.out.println("Handled event: " + evt.getMessage());
    }
}`
Also, for two event types in a single method (no params):

`@EventListener(classes = {EventA.class, EventB.class})
public void multiHandle() {
   // logic for both types
}

@EventListener(classes = {EventA.class, EventB.class})
public void multiHandle() {
   // logic for both types
}`
📋 Comparison Table
Concept
Purpose
Notes
ApplicationEventPublisher
Injected interface used to publish events
Accepts ApplicationEvent or any object (POJO) since Spring 4.2
@EventListener
Annotation to receive and handle published events
Handles both Spring events and arbitrary payloads
Optional condition and @Order
Filter by expression or control execution order
SpEL-based filtering and ordering supported
Async Option (@Async)
Process event in separate thread asynchronously
Does not support returning a value for republishing
Returning value from listener
Automatically republished as an event
Supports arrays/collections as batches

✅ Why Use These?
. Loose coupling: publishers do not need to know who handles the event.
. Clean separation of responsibilities and easier maintainability
. Supports both synchronous (within transaction) and asynchronous handling.
. Can trigger new events from listeners automatically, enabling chaining behavior.

🧠 Additional Insights
. Implementing ApplicationListener<T> is the older approach; @EventListener is more flexible and concise.
. @EventListener is processed via EventListenerMethodProcessor and works out-of-the-box in modern Spring apps
. There is no guarantee of delivery reliability; Spring events are not persisted or retried by default—retry or message-driven mechanisms must be implemented explicitly if needed.
. For distributed or cross-module scenarios (like Spring Modulith), local ApplicationEventPublisher may not suffice—consider using Reactor Sinks, messaging, or transactional event publishing instead.

👍 Sample Setup Recap
Publisher class:

`@Component
public class Publisher {
    @Autowired
    ApplicationEventPublisher p;

public void doSomething() {
        p.publishEvent(new MyEvent(this, payload));
    }
}`
Listener class:

`@Component
public class Listener {
    @EventListener
    public void handle(MyEvent e) {
        // handle event
    }
}
`
Optional enhancements:
. Add @Async for background processing.
. Use @Order to define listener precedence.
. Use condition = "#root.event.payload > 5" for conditional logic.
